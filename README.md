# Project Documentation: Signal Equalizer Desktop Application

---

**Introduction:**
Signal equalizers are essential tools in the music and speech industries, with applications extending into the biomedical field, such as detecting abnormalities in hearing aids. This project involves developing a desktop application that allows users to modify signal frequencies using sliders and then reconstruct the signal.

**Project Description:**
The application will enable users to open a signal and adjust the magnitude of specific frequency components using sliders. The key features and modes of operation include:

1. **Uniform Range Mode:**
   - The frequency range of the input signal is divided uniformly into ten equal ranges, each controlled by a slider.
   - A synthetic signal file composed of several pure single frequencies across the entire frequency range will be used to validate the functionality.

2. **Musical Instruments Mode:**
   - Each slider controls the magnitude of a specific musical instrument in a mixture of at least four different instruments.

3. **Animal Sounds Mode:**
   - Each slider controls the magnitude of a specific animal sound in a mixture of at least four different animal sounds.

4. **ECG Abnormalities Mode:**
   - The application will use four ECG signals: one normal and three with different types of arrhythmias. Each slider will control the magnitude of the arrhythmia component in the input signal.

**Functional Requirements:**
- **Frequency Modification:** 
  - Users can modify the frequency components by adjusting sliders.
  - Four types of smoothing windows (Rectangle, Hamming, Hanning, Gaussian) should be available, with options to customize and apply them through the UI.
  
- **UI Elements:**
  - Sliders to control frequency components.
  - Two linked cine signal viewers for input and output signals, with functionality to play, stop, pause, speed control, zoom, pan, and reset.
  - Two spectrograms for input and output signals, reflecting changes made with the equalizer sliders.
  - Option to toggle the visibility of spectrograms.
  
- **Mode Switching:**
  - Easy switching between different modes (Uniform Range, Musical Instruments, Animal Sounds, ECG Abnormalities) through an option menu or combobox.

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Frameworks:** PyQt5 for the GUI, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib for visualization.
- **Code Practices:**
  - Proper naming conventions for variables and functions.
  - Avoidance of code repetition by encapsulating repetitive code into functions.

**Project Timeline:**
- **Week 1:** Initial setup, UI design, and implementation of the Uniform Range Mode.
- **Week 2:** Development of Musical Instruments Mode and Animal Sounds Mode.
- **Week 3:** Implementation of ECG Abnormalities Mode.
- **Week 4:** Testing, debugging, and final adjustments.

**Conclusion:**
This project aims to create a versatile and user-friendly signal equalizer desktop application with multiple modes of operation and a robust set of features to enhance user experience and functionality in various applications, including music, speech, and biomedical fields.
